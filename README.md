# Responsive Layout Debug Information

A simple solution to clearly tell what Media Query is "active" during responsive site development and the current size of the viewport.

## Instructions

1. Place `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/responsive-debug.css">` in the head of your project's document
2. *(Optional)* - Place `<script src="js/responsive-debug.js"></script>` before `</body>` to get viewport dimensions

## Breakpoints

* Greater Than 1440px *(Large Screen)*
* 1024px - 1440px *(Desktop)*
* 768px - 1024px *(Landscape Tablets)*
* Smaller Than 768px *(Portrait tablets)*
* Smaller Than 480px *(Phones, smaller screens)*
* Smaller Than 320px *(Low Res Devices)*
